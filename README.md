# Spring MVC 
## Training With JDBC

Personal project created to learn to use Spring MVC and JDBC with MySql for database access. 

The web app is a very simple ebook library which supports some basic CRUD operations regarding ebooks. 
It also presents the stored ebooks with pagination (The "Read" Button on the tiles is just for decoration). 
The pagination is managed by the app and changes as content is updated.

It uses MySql for database operations. A script is included to create and populate the database with some ebooks for testing =>
